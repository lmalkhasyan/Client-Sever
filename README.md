Server Requirements:
1. Server shall allow a maximum of 5 clients to connect simultaneously.
2. Server shall have a command handler that can receive commands from Client and
respond back. The following commands must be supported in Server command handler:
a. disconnect
Once the Server receives this command from the Client, it should close the
connection with the Client.

Once the Server receives this command from the Client it should execute the
COMMAND as Shell command and send the response back to Client.
From Client side:
